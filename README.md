Recruitment App
===============

This is an application built for a university project. It is a web-based
application for recruiting people for a fictional company. Both applicants and
recruiters have their own view of the system. Applicants can log in to fill out
details about their application while recruiters can browse among the
applications.

The project consists of three separate code bases; The backend server that
provides a REST API, the frontend website and a standalone command line tool
that measures the response time of the backend.
